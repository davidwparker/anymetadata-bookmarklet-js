h1. Any Metadata Bookmarklet

The Any Metadata Bookmarklet is a bookmarklet which allows a person to save any metadata about a Domain that they would like (duh).  It uses html5 localStorage.

To use, just load the script onto a server of your choice and add a bookmarklet with the following code (line breaks and spaces added for readability, remove them):

<code>
javascript:(function(){
_amd=document.createElement('SCRIPT');
_amd.type='text/javascript';
_amd.src='http://davidwparker.com/js/anymetadata.bookmarklet.js';
document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(_amd);})();
</code>

or just use the bookmarklet that's on my server.

<a href="javascript:(function(){_amd=document.createElement('SCRIPT');_amd.type='text/javascript';_amd.src='http://davidwparker.com/js/anymetadata.bookmarklet.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(_amd);})();">Any Metadata</a>

There are some things which I would like to see changed/added:

# Add some tests!
# Load json2, jQuery, and jQuery-ui and theme in a better manner.  
# Make it so I don't need to use intervals to check that the scripts/css were inserted into the dom before using them.
# Allow the bookmarklet to save to a specific URL and not just the domain.
# Allow the bookmarklet to save to a server and not just localStorage (for cross-browser metadata).

Any feedback is appreciated.
